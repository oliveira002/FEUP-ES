# Product Name 
 - Course Overview

## Vision Stament
For students who often experience a hard time handling information of a course, the **Course Overview** is an open source application that allows students to easily check not only their timetables, but also to create groups and access other relevant details of a course. Unlike Sigarra, our product offers a simpler and friendly way to acess and manage its information.

## Main Features
 - Feature 1 - When clicking on a specific course, additional information about it will be displayed. This information will be regarding methods of evaluation, the main goals of the course, teachers information, etc...
 - Feature 2 - Being able to create groups within classes, adding other "students" as friends.
 - Feature 3 - Given a group and its members, the app should create a schedule available to every student (taking in account their own timetables), where they can work on the group project.

## Required API's
- Course Information from Sigarra.
- Student Timetable from Sigarra.
